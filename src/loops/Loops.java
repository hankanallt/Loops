/*for each loop

The for each loop is generally used with a collection
(e. g. array). By using the for each loop, you can
access all element's of the collection without
knowing the number of items in*/

/*do while loop

The do while loop is like the while loop except that
in do while loop, the block of code is at least
executed one time although the condition is not
true.
The reason is that condition is checked at the
bottom, not the top of the loop.*/

//syntax: for (start value; condition; updating)
//The code in for loop will be executed from the start value
//until the condition is met.
//The updating will be made continuously to the start value
//until the condition is met.


//Incrementing and decrementing

// i++ has been used to add 1 to i.
//This is called incrementing.

// You can decrement i by using i-- .

// If you use ++i then the value is incremented before the condition is tested and

// if it is i++ then i is incremented after the condition is tested.

//Multiple lines of code in the For loop

/*If you want the program to execute many
lines of code in the For loop, you must put
those lines in brackets { }.*/

/*while loop

The code in while loop will be
executed while the condition is
true.

Syntax:

start value;
